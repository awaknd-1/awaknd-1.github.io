## About Me

I am a neuroscientist and machine learning researcher with a deep interest in understanding brain function through computational methods. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Electronics from the University of Delhi, followed by an M.Sc. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering and a Ph.D. in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Brunel University London. My doctoral research focused on decoding imagined speech from EEG data using deep learning models.

Currently, I work as a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Neurosurgery at Nationwide Children’s Hospital** in Columbus, Ohio. My research centers on **stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG)** and **MRI data analysis**, where I analyze brain signals to help map functional regions and support epilepsy surgery planning. I work closely with neurosurgeons and clinicians to build neuroimaging pipelines and extract meaningful insights from complex brain datasets.

Alongside my academic research, I have **industry experience as a Data Scientist**, where I applied AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I developed NLP-driven models to predict workforce salaries and created scalable data pipelines using **Bayesian inference** for integrating diverse datasets. I also collaborated on building retrieval-augmented generation systems using large language models (LLMs), focusing on explainability and robustness in decision-making. My work bridged technical depth with practical impact, demonstrating how data-driven tools can support business intelligence and human resource analytics.

Over the years, I have contributed to interdisciplinary projects that span **neuroimaging**, **signal processing**, **natural language processing**, and **decision science**. I am also passionate about education and mentorship. I have taught undergraduate and Master's students in topics ranging from embedded systems to EEG analysis. I’ve facilitated interdisciplinary training through Brunel University’s READY Programme and led mindfulness and meditation sessions to promote mental well-being in academic environments.

With a background that integrates engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning, my mission is to harness the power of data to uncover the intricacies of the human brain—and to translate those insights into meaningful applications in healthcare, education, and beyond.
